# Data Structures

**Parsons School of Design, The New School**  
**School of Art, Media and Technology**  

Welcome to my submission for the final assignments for the Data Structures class of the Fall 2018 semester at Parsons.

This website will guide you through the three projects, how they became what they are today, and will link you out to the live demos. 

## About

> Curating raw data presents issues of technology, speed, and efficiency, as well as broader ethical considerations of what it means to represent and make conclusions about groups and individuals from their data. This course covers the database, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. Students will gain familiarity with underlying data structures; techniques and tools, including acquisition, augmentation, and restructuring; data storage and aggregation; access to parallel and distributed computing; high-volume data, disparate sources, and performance; and streaming data, real time, and dynamic queries.

Over the course of 15 weeks, we have been looking at a variety of topics regarding data, including fundamental data structures, modeling semi-structured data, querying, data cleaning, physical sensors (IoT), interface design, and reliability, scalability, maintainability, and sustainability. During these same weeks, 11 weekly assignments have been made. These assignments can be found on the [`rijkvanzanten/data-structures-weekly-assignments`](https://github.com/rijkvanzanten/data-structures-weekly-assignments/) repo.

Most of the weekly assignments where directly related to the following final assignments.

Each of the final assignments has one specific main focus _and_ an additional personal challenge.

## Projects

* [AA Meetings Interactive Map (SQL)](/aa-meetings)
